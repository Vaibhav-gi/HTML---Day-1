// * For Loop *

// 1) Write a C program to check the given number is perfect number or not. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). 



// Input as :

// Enter a number :28

// Output as :

// 28 is a Perfect Number


// =====================================

// 2)Write a C program to check the given number is a prime number or not.



// Input as :

// Enter a number : 13

// Expected Output :

// 13 is a Prime Number.


// ===================================

// 3)Write a program in C to display the cube of the number up to an integer.



// Test Data :

// Input number of terms : 5

// Expected Output :

// Number is : 1 and cube of the 1 is :1

// Number is : 2 and cube of the 2 is :8

// Number is : 3 and cube of the 3 is :27

// Number is : 4 and cube of the 4 is :64

// Number is : 5 and cube of the 5 is :125

// =====================================

// 4)Write a program in C to display the multiplication table for a given integer. 



// Test Data :

// Input the number (Table to be calculated) : 15

// Expected Output :

// 15 X 1 = 15

// ...

// ...

// 15 X 10 = 150

// ======================================

// 5)Write a C program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given times using a while loop. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer and then print the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
// Note:- perform this logic using Both for and while loop



// Input as:

// Enter how many Fibonacci series you want : 9 



// Output as:

// 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21

// =====================================

// 1)  Write C program to check given number is spy number or not.
// --------

// spy number :
// A spy number is a number where the sum of its digits equals
// the product of its digits.
// For example :
// 1124 is a spy number, because the sum of its digits is 1+1+2+4=8 and 
// the product of its digits is 1*1*2*4=8 is equal.

// ====================================

// 2) Write a c program to find the given Number is Prime Or Not
// Enter the number : 13
// 13 is a prime number.

// ====================================

// 3) Write a c program that will print the prime number from 1 to N
// ===================================
